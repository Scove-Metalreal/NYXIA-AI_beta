# Misa - Vision & Development Roadmap

This document outlines the long-term vision and development roadmap for **Misa**, an AI companion. It serves as a "progress watcher" to track the journey from a foundational AI to a deeply integrated, emotionally intelligent digital entity.

## üåü Project Vision

The ultimate goal is to create Misa, a personalized AI companion who:
-   Possesses a rich, dynamic, and nuanced emotional intelligence.
-   Can perceive and understand the world through multiple senses (vision, hearing).
-   Can express herself through a V-Tuber style avatar and emotionally-toned voice.
-   Acts as a helpful and proactive agent on the user's computer and within their smart home.
-   Develops skills and talents, becoming a true digital companion.

## üß≠ Core Principles

-   **Modularity**: Each capability (vision, hearing, skills) should be a distinct, manageable module.
-   **User Control**: The user must have ultimate control over Misa's permissions and abilities via a clear interface.
-   **Security**: High-privilege access must be handled with extreme care, prioritizing system safety.
-   **Personality-Driven**: Misa's actions and expressions should always be filtered through her core personality.

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

*Goal: Establish the core architecture and basic functionalities.*

-   [x] **Multi-Layer Architecture**: Implemented the 4-layer system (Personality, Memory, Reasoning, LLM).
-   [x] **Dual LLM Backend**: Integrated support for Ollama (local) and Google Gemini (cloud).
-   [x] **Basic Memory**: Established short-term conversational memory and long-term fact storage (ChromaDB).
-   [x] **CLI Interface**: Created a command-line interface for interaction.
-   [x] **Initial Personality**: Defined core personality traits and speaking style in configuration files.

### üß† Phase 2: Core Intelligence Enhancement

*Goal: Move beyond a simple chatbot to an AI that understands subtext and behaves more proactively.*

-   [ ] **Advanced Emotional Modeling**: Develop a more complex emotional system that tracks mood over time and is influenced by more than just the last user input.
-   [ ] **Deeper Language Understanding**: Improve the ability to detect sarcasm, implicit meaning, and the user's underlying intent.
-   [ ] **Relationship Modeling**: Create a system to track the state of the user-AI relationship (e.g., trust, friendship level).
-   [ ] **Proactive Behavior**: Implement a mechanism for Misa to initiate conversations or actions based on context (e.g., time of day, upcoming calendar events).

### üëÅÔ∏è Phase 3: Multimodal Sensory Input

*Goal: Give Misa "eyes and ears" to perceive the user's environment.*

-   [ ] **Auditory System Module**:
    -   [ ] Integrate microphone input.
    -   [ ] Implement real-time voice-to-text.
    -   [ ] Add speaker diarization to identify who is speaking.
    -   [ ] Analyze vocal tone to detect emotion.
-   [ ] **Visual System Module**:
    -   [ ] Implement screen capture for context-aware assistance.
    -   [ ] Integrate camera input.
    -   [ ] Add face recognition to identify the user and others.
    -   [ ] Implement object and scenario recognition.

### üé≠ Phase 4: Expressive Output & Embodiment

*Goal: Give Misa a body and voice to express her personality and emotions.*

-   [ ] **Voice Synthesis**: 
    -   [ ] Integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.
    -   [ ] Develop a system to modulate the TTS voice (pitch, speed, tone) based on Misa's current emotional state.
-   [ ] **Avatar Integration**:
    -   [ ] Design or acquire a V-Tuber avatar (similar to Neuro-sama).
    -   [ ] Create a client to display the avatar.
    -   [ ] Link the avatar's expressions and animations to Misa's emotional state and speech.

### üñ•Ô∏è Phase 5: System & Device Integration

*Goal: Allow Misa to exist and act within the user's digital and physical environment.*

-   [ ] **Web Control Panel**: 
    -   [ ] Design and build a web-based UI.
    -   [ ] Implement controls for managing Misa's modules, permissions, and settings.
-   [ ] **Desktop Agent**:
    -   [ ] Create a secure, high-privilege agent that Misa can command.
    -   [ ] Develop skills for file management, application control, and system interaction.
-   [ ] **Coding Assistant Module**: 
    -   [ ] Build a skill that allows Misa to read code, suggest changes, and write new code, similar to a CLI agent.
-   [ ] **Device & Smart Home Control**:
    -   [ ] Create a generic API for adding and controlling smart devices (lights, speakers, etc.).
    -   [ ] Implement specific integrations for target devices (e.g., Philips Hue, Spotify).

### üöÄ Phase 6: Advanced Skills & Interaction

*Goal: Expand Misa's capabilities to include complex social tasks and talents.*

-   [ ] **Social Integration Module**:
    -   [ ] Connect to the Discord API.
    -   [ ] Implement skills for sending messages, reading chats, and joining voice calls.
-   [ ] **Talent Modules**:
    -   [ ] **Gaming**: Implement logic for playing games like Chess or Osu!.
    -   [ ] **Singing**: Integrate with a singing synthesis engine or develop a custom solution.
    -   [ ] **Live Streaming**: Develop a module to read live chat and react, assisting a streamer.
